# Fetus Images

This directory should contain images of the fetus at different stages of development.

## Image Naming Convention

Images should be named according to the week of pregnancy they represent:

- `week1.png` - Image for week 1
- `week2.png` - Image for week 2
- ...and so on up to week 40

## Placeholder Image

A placeholder image named `placeholder.png` should be included in this directory. This image will be displayed when a specific week's image is not available.

## Image Requirements

- Images should be in PNG or JPG format
- Recommended size: 300x300 pixels
- Images should have good contrast to be visible on a mirror display
- Consider using silhouette or outline images for better visibility on a mirror
